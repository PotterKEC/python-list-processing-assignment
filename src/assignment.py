This assignment focuses on list manipulation and data processing in Python.
You will implement functions to process lists of numbers using various algorithms.

def find_peaks(numbers):
    """
    Find all peak values in a list of numbers. A peak is a number that is greater
    than both its left and right neighbors.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of peak values in the order they appear
        
    Example:
        find_peaks([1, 3, 2, 3, 5, 3]) -> [3, 5]
    """
    pass

def running_average(numbers, window_size):
    """
    Calculate the running average for a list of numbers using the specified window size.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers
        window_size (int): The size of the moving window
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of running averages, rounded to 2 decimal places
        
    Example:
        running_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3) -> [2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
    """
    pass

def find_duplicates(numbers):
    """
    Find all numbers that appear more than once in the list.
    Return them in ascending order.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers
        
    Returns:
        list: A sorted list of numbers that appear multiple times
        
    Example:
        find_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]) -> [2, 3]
